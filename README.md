# Angular dev environment setup #

## Set up the Development Environment ##
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine.
Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running 'node -v' and 'npm -v' in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.
Then install the Angular CLI globally.
'npm install -g @angular/cli'

## Restore npm packages ##
Go to the project directory (rootFolder\src\VolleyManagement.WebClient\spa)
Run 'npm install'

## Serve the application ##
Go to the project directory (rootFolder\src\VolleyManagement.WebClient\spa) and launch the server.
'ng serve --open'
The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.
Using the --open (or just -o) option will automatically open your browser on http://localhost:4200/.
Another option is to run 'npm start' from the project directory it will run 'ng serve'.
