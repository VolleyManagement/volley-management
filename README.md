## What is this repository for? ##

The goal of the project is to create system to manage Volleyball sport events for amateur leagues.
Also it serves as a training ground to try different engineering and architectural approaches to learn in a safe environment.

Current Version: v3

## How do I get set up? ##

### Summary of set up ###

Project uses .NET Core and Angular at the moment. Recommended tools are VS 2019 (any edition) and VS Code. Although it should run using any other setup , I hope :)

Target framework is .NET Core 3.0.

### Dependencies ###

All .NET dependencies are managed via NuGet. Angular uses NPM.

### Database configuration (üöß outdated) ###

Database is automatically deployed to server first time you run application. Specify proper connection string in Web.config file in VolleyManagement.UI project.

By default it is configured to use SQL Server 2016 LocalDB. But you can can change altering connection string.

### Deployment instructions ###

To run code locally it is recommended to use Docker to spin up local instance and test. This options is the closest to the production setting.
You have few options there:

* Use VS Container Tools and run start project using `Docker` launch profile. VS injects few useful items like debugger so you'll be able to debug code running inside Docker.

* Build and run container manually. See `/dev-env` folder for some scripts.

If you want to shorten development cycle you can run application locally. Use `VolleyM.API` launch profile. It will execute `dotnet run`.

In production we use Azure DevOps Pipeline to build and deploy code.

### How to run tests ###

#### Unit Tests ####

Project uses xUnit framework.

* Run tests using `dotnet`

> `dotnet test src/VolleyManagement.sln`

* Run using Visual Studio UI

#### API Tests ####

Project uses [Karate](https://github.com/intuit/karate) to test API.

Before you run them you need to run application locally.

1. Open `karate-tests` VS Code workspace
  
  * install recommended extensions

2. Download Karate Standalone using script.

> `.\get-karate.ps1`

3. Install latest Java Runtime.

4. Set Environment variables required to run locally:

> `.\set-dev-envirronment.ps1`

_Note: You might need to restart VS Code in order for variable to take effect_

5. Run all tests:

> `java -jar karate.jar -e dev .`

6. You can use Karate Runner extension to run any particular test as well.
