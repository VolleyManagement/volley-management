## What is this repository for? ##

The goal of the project is to create system to manage Volleyball sport events for amateur leagues.
Also it serves as a training ground to try different engineering and architectural approaches to learn in a safe environment.

## How do I get set up? ##

### Summary of set up ###

Project uses .NET Core and Angular at the moment. Recommended tools are VS 2019 (any edition) and VS Code. Although it should run using any other setup , I hope :)

Target framework is .NET Core 3.0.

### Dependencies ###

All .NET dependencies are managed via NuGet. Angular uses NPM.

### Development Environment Setup ###

Follow this [Guide](../../wiki/Dev-Env-Guide).

### Deployment instructions ###

#### Prepare Azure Storage ####

In order to configure Azure Storage locally you need to run migrations to setup all required tables.

1. Prepare migration. Run following command:

    > `./migrations/publish-azure-storage-migration.ps1`

2. Run migration itself:

    > `cd ./migrations/azureStorageMigration`
    
    > `dotnet VolleyM.Tools.MigrationTool.dll`

#### Run Code ####

To run code locally it is recommended to use Docker to spin up local instance and test. This options is the closest to the production setting.
You have few options there:

* Use VS Container Tools and run start project using `Docker` launch profile. VS injects few useful items like debugger so you'll be able to debug code running inside Docker.

* Build and run container manually. See `/dev-env` folder for some scripts.

If you want to shorten development cycle you can run application locally. Use `VolleyM.API` launch profile. It will execute `dotnet run`.

In production we use Azure DevOps Pipeline to build and deploy code.

### How to run tests ###
